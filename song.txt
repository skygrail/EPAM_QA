I didn't see it coming
But I never really had much faith
In the universe's magic, oh no
Till it pulled us to that time and place, and I'll never forget
When the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
It still has me choking, it's hard to explain
I know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain
